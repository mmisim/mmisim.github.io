      <h4>Pia in New York, NY</h4>
      <p><i>Samantha made our wedding cake for us. We wanted a gluten free cake that would be simple and elegant but most importantly delicious. Please do not overthink your decision to use Samantha - she was receptive and responsive to every request and question and is clearly a most talented pastry chef. We were so overjoyed with the cake!!! Not only was it so beautiful (and exactly how we wanted it to look) but it was beyond delicious!! Our guests could not believe it was gluten free. We will certainly be using Samantha’s talents again! Thank you Samantha!</i>

      <h4>Ashley in Brooklyn, NY</h4>
      <p><i>I hosted a baby shower for a friend and ended up being so busy, I knew that I needed to recruit help with the desserts. I reached out to Sam and told her how many people I'd be hosting and the theme of the shower and she took the reins from there. She told me how much I would need for the party size and gave me a great price. She suggested some decorated sugar cookies, a small one tier cake, and mini cupcakes. On the day of the shower, Sam delivered everything to me personally. The desserts professionally boxed and she even lent me a cake stand for the cake! The cake was bigger and even more beautiful than I had expected (simple, elegant, and exactly the theme I wanted), the mini cupcakes were really cute, and the cookies were perfectly decorated. Of course, everything tasted wonderful! The mamma-to-be couldn't stop raving about how much she loved the cookies. The amount Sam suggested was perfect! We had just a few cookies left over and it was not hard to convince guests to take them home. It was so easy working with Sam and I felt so relieved with dessert in the hands of a professional! I will recommend her to anyone in need of beautiful, tasty desserts!</i>

      <h4>Emily in Boone, NC</h4>

      <p><i>Our wedding cake, prepared by Sam, could not have been more perfect! Sam is talented, professional and a delight to work with- she asked all the right questions and took all of our wishes into consideration to craft an absolutely beautiful, delicious cake that fit with the style of our wedding to a T. We were amazed at how well it stood up to the Florida heat and humidity in August for our beach wedding - every detail looked absolutely perfect the whole night. So many of our guests commented that it was the best cake they had ever tasted (lemon cake with cream cheese frosting) and I couldn’t agree more. Thank you for making our special day that much more special! </i>

      <h4>Mandy in Brooklyn, NY</h4>
      <p><i>For my 30th birthday, I wanted to treat myself to the cake of my dreams! Samantha helped me brainstorm and figure out exactly what I wanted. The cake turned out just how I imagined it! She even added some extra flair, like gold-dusted sugar roses and a cute little personalized banner. The cake was gorgeous and delicious, down to the last rainbow sprinkle. Samantha really made me feel special on my birthday. I can't recommend her enough! </i>
